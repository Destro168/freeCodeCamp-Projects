# Hello and welcome to my freeCodeCamp Projects.

## Introduction

The 30 projects stored in this repository represent over 600 hours of work spent to obtain the freeCodeCamp Full Stack Certification.

To review these projects efficiently, I recommend downloading this entire repository and opening up each projectâ€™s index.html one by one. Please also review the code too to see the style and flavor that I infuse into all of my work.

## Responsive Web Design Projects

These projects are all meant to demonstrate mastery of basic HTML and CSS. They are not meant to be hard or the most complex projects.

## JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

These projects demonstrate my ability to craft algorithms to solve complex problems with multiple factors. Please use these JavaScript files as a peek into my raw problem-solving skills. And, please do not disregard the JavaScript in my other projects, as they are all valuable too.

## Front End Libraries Projects

These projects all use React as the primary framework to set them up. I did not use Redux while making these projects as it was not required and they were not complex to the extent that I felt that it would be needed. Perhaps in the future I will make a project while using Redux to demonstrate my ability.

## Data Visualization Projects

These projects were without a doubt the hardest projects of all. In my opinion, navigating the d3.js API documentation to create solutions that would pass freeCodeCamp tests was a nightmare. However, through pure tenacity, I managed to figure out all of the quirks with d3.js and freeCodeCamp by using tens of project examples and navigating tens of bug reports on the freeCodeCamp GitHub and forums.

## APIs and Microservices Projects

These projects demonstrate mastery of NPM, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDb JS Driver and Mongoose.js.

Reviewing these projects is a bit trickier than the other projects, because each project can only be reviewed by going to the glitch link included in each text file. (Unless you want to and can manage to download and setup each project locally!)

So, if you manage to get far enough into reviewing my work that you actually want to review these projects, then I really recommend reviewing the project descriptions by going to the freeCodeCamp website and viewing each projects description one by one.(For example: https://learn.freecodecamp.org/information-security-and-quality-assurance/information-security-and-quality-assurance-projects/metric-imperial-converter for the metric-imperial-converter).

A TODO list item for me is to improve the verbosity of my description files and potentially even download the glitch projects to include them in this repo.

## Information Security and Quality Assurance

Similarly to the APIs and Microservices Projects, these have to be viewed in glitch. They cover more advanced topics and really test one's ability to make RESTful APIs that are fully unit-tested with Chai.js.
