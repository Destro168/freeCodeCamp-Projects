  <h1 id="title">Visualize Data with a Choropleth Map Project</h1>
  <p id="description">This is a Choropleth map of education data by state.</p>
  <p>Author's Notes: This project was the ultimate moral dillema for me.

    Up until this point, the Data Visualization projects could be mostly solved using just the API Reference and FCC
    Lessons. However, for this project,
    it is almost impossible to solve without using API Reference. Furthermore, the API Reference for d3-geo is very
    hard to understand on it's own, which
    makes it almost mandatory that one use the examples on the API-reference to understand the code.

    And therein lies the problem: the examples. The d3 geo page @ https://observablehq.com/collection/@d3/d3-geo
    literally has a Choropleth map as one of the examples as a reference.

    So, this raises the questions: Is it fair play to use an example provided by the d3.js developers to solve the
    project? Or, is it cheating?

    After much contemplation, I decided that the examples in the API Reference are fair play. While, I absolutely will
    not use project solutions clearly marked as the
    solution for a project, I too absolutely won't limit the myself to excluding any portion of the official product
    documentation for solving a project.

    To me, referencing the official documentation can never be viewed as 'cheating'. Referencing documentation is a
    mandatory part of programming. And, I am not going to cripple my ability
    to solve the problem efficiently due to the project duplicating documentation.

    As such, I implemented the solution in such a way that I avoided copy-pasting hte answer directly. And, I insist
    that the project is insufficiently unique to test one's skills effectively.
